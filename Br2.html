  <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup (4oz/120g) white sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 cup (3oz/90g) brown sugar</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons (3oz/90g) butter</li>
      <li>2 large eggs*</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 cup (4oz/120g) cocoa powder, unsweetened</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/2 cup (3oz/90g) chocolate chips</li>
  </ul>
<br>
<p>
<br>1.Combine the sugars and butter in a microwavable bowl (or in a pot on the stove). Heat until the butter has melted. Remove from heat and beat well with a hand mixer for 2-3 minutes. (I tried doing this recipe without an electric mixer and my cookies came out really flat)
<br><br>2.Add in the eggs and vanilla extract and beat with hand mixer for 2 minutes (this, along with melting the butter and sugar, helps create a crackly crust on top of the cookies).
<br><br>3.Stir together the cocoa powder and salt and add them to the batter. Beat for another 30 seconds. Lastly fold in the chocolate chips. The batter will be soft but refrigerate it for a minimum of 30 minutes.
<br><br>4.Preheat the oven to 350Â°F (180oC). When the cookie dough is stiff scoop 12 cookies onto a baking tray lined with parchment. Round the dough in your hands and press to flatten down just a little. Toss a few more chocolate chips on top it you wish.
<br><br>5.Bake cookies for about 12-13 minutes. When baked they might look 'uncooked' but they are not, they are perfectly fudgy on the inside.
<br><br>6.Set aside to cool down and enjoy fresh. Store them in an airtight container for up to 2 days.
